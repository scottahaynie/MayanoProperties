Can you center the dots vertically?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you center the dots vertically in the carousel navigation. Looking at the code, the dots are in a flex container but need vertical alignment. I'll modify the container's classes to include vertical centering.

I'll edit the file to add the necessary Tailwind classes:

```diff
            </button>
          </div>
-         <div className="flex justify-center mt-4 space-x-2">
+         <div className="flex justify-center items-center mt-4 space-x-2">
            {featured.map((_, idx) => (
              <button
```

---

I've added the `items-center` Tailwind class to the flex container. This will ensure that the dots are vertically centered within their container. The change maintains all the existing horizontal spacing and margin while adding the vertical alignment you requested.
